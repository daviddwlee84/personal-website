My name is Da-Wei Lee (David Lee). I am an ex-Data & Applied Scientist at Microsoft. Currently working at a Quant company doing trading strategy research using Machine Learning. Enjoy being a **maker** - think of any creative idea and try hard to make it come true. I love to play music and any other cool stuff. I have a huge enthusiasm for learning and curiosity about discovering. Also, I am very willing to help people and sharing what I have learned.
